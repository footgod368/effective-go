# Effective Go

This project is based on Google's Effective Go tutorial that teaches how to write idiomatic Go code located <a href="https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html">here</a>.

## Description

This project is test based so it allows to a new go learner to quickly execute code, see how it behaves, make small changes and observe what happens. See <a href="http://blog.gaku.net/match/">here</a> how to run specific tests.

Follow the <a href="https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html">Effective Go tutorial</a>. The packages are named accordingly.

## Environment

**1. Install go**

Go to https://golang.org/doc/install and follow the instructions. Don't forget to set GOPATH variable.

**2. Clone the git repository**
```bash
cd $GOPATH/src
git clone https://github.com/matijavizintin/effective-go.git
```

**3. Install dependencies**
```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/effective-go
go get -t ./...
```

**4. Open the project in your editor of choice**

I personally use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA<a/> with go <a href="https://github.com/go-lang-plugin-org">plugin</a> but any editor will do just fine.

## Note

If you find any bugs a pull request will be much appreciated. Thank you.
